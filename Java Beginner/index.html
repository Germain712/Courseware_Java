      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Java</strong>
        is a general purpose, class based, object orientated programming
        language. It was released in 1995, and is currently one of the most
        popular programming languages in use.
      </p>
      <p>
        The language is intended to be a
        <em> write once, run anywhere</em> language. This means once
        <em>compiled</em>
        (i.e. translated in a method that the computer can understand), Java
        code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for
        recompilation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Java applications achieve this by compiling into byte code that can run
        on any <span>Java Virtual Machine</span> (JVM), regardless of the
        underlying computer architecture.
      </p>
      <p>
        Java has its own <em>syntax</em> that defines the structure of how we
        can code as well as the phrases we can use. This syntax is the
        definition of the instructions that the JVM needs to execute.
      </p>
      <h3>Why use Java?</h3>
      <p>
        There are a number of reasons to use Java as a programming language for
        a piece of software you are creating. Some of these include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Open-source</strong>: the standard edition of Java (Java SE)
          is free to use!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Popularity</strong>: Java still remains as one of the most
          popular languages in the industry, used by huge corporations
          worldwide.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Developement power</strong>: the security, complexity, and
          structure Java provides as a programming language is incredibly useful
          for projects of all sizes.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      In this module, we will be going over how to implement "Hello World" in
      Java.
    </p>
    <h2>Tutorial</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      First, we need to make sure that we have installed Java, if you haven't
      done this check out the Java Installation module. Then we will need to
      install an Integrated Development Environmeny (IDE), we will be using
      Eclipse. Then we can create a Java project in our IDE, we will be going
      over how to do this in Eclipse.
    </p>
    <h3>Installing Eclipse</h3>
    <hr />
    <ol>
      <li>
        Download Eclipse Installer from
        <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/"
