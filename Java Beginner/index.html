      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Java</strong>
        is a general purpose, class based, object orientated programming
        language. It was released in 1995, and is currently one of the most
        popular programming languages in use.
      </p>
      <p>
        The language is intended to be a
        <em> write once, run anywhere</em> language. This means once
        <em>compiled</em>
        (i.e. translated in a method that the computer can understand), Java
        code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for
        recompilation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Java applications achieve this by compiling into byte code that can run
        on any <span>Java Virtual Machine</span> (JVM), regardless of the
        underlying computer architecture.
      </p>
      <p>
        Java has its own <em>syntax</em> that defines the structure of how we
        can code as well as the phrases we can use. This syntax is the
        definition of the instructions that the JVM needs to execute.
      </p>

      <h3>Why use Java?</h3>
      <p>
        There are a number of reasons to use Java as a programming language for
        a piece of software you are creating. Some of these include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Open-source</strong>: the standard edition of Java (Java SE)
          is free to use!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Popularity</strong>: Java still remains as one of the most
          popular languages in the industry, used by huge corporations
          worldwide.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Developement power</strong>: the security, complexity, and
          structure Java provides as a programming language is incredibly useful
          for projects of all sizes.
        </li>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      In this module, we will be going over how to implement "Hello World" in
      Java.
    </p>

    <h2>Tutorial</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      First, we need to make sure that we have installed Java, if you haven't
      done this check out the Java Installation module. Then we will need to
      install an Integrated Development Environmeny (IDE), we will be using
      Eclipse. Then we can create a Java project in our IDE, we will be going
      over how to do this in Eclipse.
    </p>

    <h3>Installing Eclipse</h3>
    <hr />
    <ol>
      <li>
        Download Eclipse Installer from
        <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/"
          >http://www.eclipse.org/downloads</a
        >
      </li>

      <img src="images/eclipseinstaller.png" alt="Download Eclipse Logo" />
      <li>Run the .exe installer</li>
      <li>Select, 'Eclipse IDE for Java Developers'</li>
      <li>Now, 'Install'</li>
      <li>
        Next, you can simply 'Launch' and Eclipse will be fully functional.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Creating a Project in Eclipse</h3>
    <p>To create a project in Eclipse, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Open Eclipse and define a directory for your workspace, this can be
        located anywhere you want, then click "Launch".
      </li>
      <li>
        Now that we have Eclipse open, click "File", then "New", then "Java
        Project".
      </li>
      <img src="images/demo_eclipse_IDE.png" alt="Demo Eclipse IDE image" />
      <li>
        Once you have clicked "Java Project" you will be presented with the
        below screen.
      </li>
      <img src="images/new_java_project.png" alt="New Java Project Image" />
      <p>
        Enter a name for your project in the top text box, and make sure you
        have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) selected. Once you have entered a
        name for your project and ensured you have a JRE click "Finish".
      </p>
      <li>
        The project will now be created and appear in the left-hand side of the
        screen under "Package Explorer". Now we need to create a package e.g.
        com.qa.helloworld. To create a new package, expand the project by
        clicking the arrow to the left of the project name, then right-click on
        the folder named "src", then hover over "New", then click "package". A
        package is used to group related classes. Package names are written in
        lower case to avoid conflict with names of classes or interfaces.
      </li>
      <img src="images/new_java_package.png" alt="New Java Package Image" />
      <li>
        Now we need to create a class for the project so that we have somewhere
        to begin writing our code. To create a new class, expand the project by
        clicking the arrow to the left of the project name, then right-click on
        the newly created package name com.qa.helloworld, then hover over "New",
        then click "Class". You should now see the below window.
      </li>
      <img src="images/new_java_class.png" alt="New Java Class Image" />
      <li>
        Enter a name for your class and click "Finish". The naming convention
        for classes is PascalCase, which means every new word has a capital
        letter at the beginning, with no spaces. Once you have clicked "Finish"
        you should see the following screen.
      </li>
      <img
        src="images/package_hello_world.png"
        alt="Package Hello World Image" />
    </ol>

    <h3>Coding Hello World</h3>
    <p>
      Now that we have our project and class setup we can begin coding our
      application. For our class to know what to run, we need to declare the
      main method in our class.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To declare the main method we need to add the following method within
        the scope of our class, the scope of the class is whatever is within the
        { }.
      </li>
      <code class="hljs Java">
        <span class="hljs-function">
          <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span
          ><span class="hljs-keyword">static</span
          ><span class="hljs-keyword">void</span
          ><span class="hljs-title">main</span>
          <span class="hljs-params"
            >"(" <span class="hljs-keyword">String</span>"[] args)"
          </span></span
        >
      </code>
      <li>
        To tell Java to print "Hello World!" to the console we will need to use
        the following line, which makes Java print to the console.
      </li>
    </ol>
